One of the major impacts of climate change is the rise in sea levels, which results from the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers. Coastal areas are particularly vulnerable, as they face higher risks of flooding, storm surges, and erosion. Additionally, the warming atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to intense and unpredictable precipitation patterns. This variability can cause both severe droughts and devastating floods, affecting agricultural productivity and water resources.\n",
